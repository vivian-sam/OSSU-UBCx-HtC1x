# OSSU-UBCx-HtC1x
Creating this repository to track my exercises and learning through one of the recommended OSSU courses: UBC x HtC1x (How to Code: Simple Data):
https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+HtC1x+2T2017/home

This course's main focus is on systematic program design method. Therefore the language used in this introductory course will be the BSL (Beginning Student Language) which is much simpler to learn but concepts can be applied to other programming languages.
The goal of this course is to build a strong foundational knowledge of computer science. 

Concepts learned include:
Module 1b: How to Design Functions
Module 2:  How to Design Data 
Module 3a: How to Design Worlds (multiple functions/design data)
Module 3b: Compound Data
Module 4a: Self-Reference
Module 4b: Reference
Module 5a: Naturals
Module 5b: Helpers (functions)
Module 6: Binary Search Trees
